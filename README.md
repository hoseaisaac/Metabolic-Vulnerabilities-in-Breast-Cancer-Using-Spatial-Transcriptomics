## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis pipeline for identifying metabolic vulnerabilities in breast cancer using spatial transcriptomics data. Our framework integrates three complementary approaches:

1. **Supervised Classification** - MetabolicVulnerabilityNet for predicting proliferation from pathway activity
2. **Unsupervised Autoencoder** - Label-independent vulnerability scoring via in-silico knockdown
3. **Flux Analysis (scFEA)** - Mechanistic support from reaction-level metabolic flux inference

## Key Results

- **Cross-patient validation**: AUC = 0.881 ± 0.060 across 7 patients
- **Cross-platform validation**: AUC = 0.828 on Visium HD (16µm resolution)
- **Universal metabolic targets**: Nucleotide biosynthesis (M_148, M_155, M_159) identified as highest-confidence therapeutic vulnerabilities

## Installation

### Option 1: Using pip

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/metabolic-vulnerabilities-breast-cancer.git
cd metabolic-vulnerabilities-breast-cancer

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Using conda

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/metabolic-vulnerabilities-breast-cancer.git
cd metabolic-vulnerabilities-breast-cancer

# Create conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate environment
conda activate metabolic-vulnerabilities
```

### scFEA Installation (for flux analysis)

scFEA requires separate installation:

```bash
# Clone scFEA repository
git clone https://github.com/changwn/scFEA.git
cd scFEA
pip install -e .
```

## Data

This study uses publicly available 10x Genomics Visium and Visium HD spatial transcriptomics data from seven breast cancer patients, originally released alongside:

> Janesick, A., Shelansky, R., Gottscho, A.D. *et al.* High resolution mapping of the tumor microenvironment using integrated single-cell, spatial and in situ analysis. *Nat Commun* **14**, 8353 (2023). [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-43458-x](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-43458-x)

- **Patients 1-6**: Standard/CytAssist Visium (55µm spot diameter), spanning fresh-frozen and FFPE preparations
- **Patient 7**: Visium HD (16µm bin size)

All raw data is hosted on 10x Genomics' public datasets portal:

- 10x Genomics Datasets (human breast cancer collection): [https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets](https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets)
- Visium HD, Human Breast Cancer (Fresh Frozen): [https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/visium-hd-cytassist-gene-expression-human-breast-cancer-fresh-frozen](https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/visium-hd-cytassist-gene-expression-human-breast-cancer-fresh-frozen)
- Visium HD, Human Breast Cancer, IF (FFPE): [https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/visium-hd-cytassist-gene-expression-libraries-human-breast-cancer-ffpe-if](https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/visium-hd-cytassist-gene-expression-libraries-human-breast-cancer-ffpe-if)
- Human Breast Cancer, Visium Fresh Frozen (Whole Transcriptome): [https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/human-breast-cancer-visium-fresh-frozen-whole-transcriptome-1-standard](https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/human-breast-cancer-visium-fresh-frozen-whole-transcriptome-1-standard)

The remaining CytAssist FF/FFPE samples (Patients 4-6) are listed under the same "Human Breast Cancer" collection on the 10x Genomics Datasets page, and the paper's own Data Availability statement lists the complete set of accession links used across all seven patients. Raw FASTQ/count matrices are not included in this repository (see [What's not in this repo](#whats-not-in-this-repo) below); download them directly from the links above.

### What's not in this repo

Raw and intermediate data files (expression matrices, per-patient pathway/flux score tables, `.h5ad` objects, spatial images) are excluded from version control here due to size — several exceed 100MB. Re-download the raw data from the links above and re-run the pipeline notebooks to regenerate them locally. The scFEA tool itself is a separate third-party dependency (see Installation) and is not vendored into this repo.

## Usage

### Running the Analysis

```bash
# Launch Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab

# Open and run: notebooks/Metabolic_Vulnerabilities.ipynb
```

### Key Analysis Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing & QC** - Filtering, normalisation, HVG selection
2. **Pathway Discovery** - Scoring 7,829 pathways from 5 databases
3. **Model Training** - MetabolicVulnerabilityNet with spatial cross-validation
4. **Autoencoder Analysis** - In-silico knockdown for vulnerability scoring
5. **LOPO Validation** - Leave-one-patient-out cross-validation
6. **Flux Analysis** - scFEA integration across all patients
